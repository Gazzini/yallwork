        <img class="yallpic" src="yallwork.jpg" alt="This entire website is just 1 long image file, but it's got a lot of parts. At the top, it's the lowercase, cursive-font letters 'y' and 'w', styled to look sort-of like ropes. There's an apostropge between them, it's fun. Below that, the words 'yallwork' are displayed with no space or apostrophe. The background is a sort-of speckled orange. There are 4 weird images of my garage with some weird inside jokes that nobody else will really get. In the first, someone is standing in a T-pose next to a foldout table with a laptop, under an american flag painted onto an old wood pallete. The text next to it says Innovate y'all workspace, yeet y'allself into the new era of wireless business proximity collaboration. The next image is a dog with an elastic cord as a leash, and the dog looks sad or scared, definitely not comfortable, curled up in a bed next to some cables & a leather belt. All the images are black-and-white btw. The text says Experience y'all man's best friend -- Love y'all dog as much as y'allself, as to not yolt y'all vibe. Continuing on, there's a picture of a benchpress with the text y'all get a sweat deal--exercise your right to use the most robust muscle torture device known to man. At the end, there's a picture of a ladder, although I guess they're really called stall bars, and the and the text is climb y'all way to success -- alexa, play the Mufasa death scene. Honestly, I don't know why it says that, ask Cole when you see him. The footer is black with the ropey letters again, and it says 'fully booked until March 2056'."/>
